# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects
The machine learning projects about Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree (MLND). 

Thanks to Udacity (Co-Created by: Kaggle Projects) provide the excellent materials for students to equip to be a data analyst or a machine learning engineer, and to apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more. 

This is a briefly introduce of the 5 projects.

## P0. Titanic Survival Exploration

### Exploration

In this introductory project, it explored a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive. To complete this project, students will need to implement several conditional predictions and answer the questions below. Students' project submission will be evaluated based on the completion of the code and your responses to the questions.

## P1. Predicting Boston Housing Prices

### Model Evaluation and Validation

In this project, it applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. First, to explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, to properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. Then, to analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable students to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, to test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

## P2. Build a Student Intervention System

### Supervised Learning

A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, the task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that you find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. It needs to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develops a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.

## P3. Creating Customer Segments

### Unsupervised Learning

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week. Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries â€” losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. As the wholesale distributor, to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. The task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

## P4. Train a Smartcab to Drive

### Reinforcement Learning

In this project, its work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal. Since the Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. Maximizing the driving agent's safety and reliability would ensure that Smartcabs have a permanent place in the transportation industry.

(The template code for the Smartcab's environment and other agents (cars) in the environment was already provided. Our job is to implement a learning algorithm so that the Smartcab behaves properly, following the rules and regulations, while moving towards its destination. )
